<h3>Dopamine Detox</h3>
<h5> Author: Gabriel Kelly</h5>
<p>Explains how our attention is hijacked by things like social media, internet & video games & how they cause us to be overstimulated and our dopamine to perhaps be processed differently so that important tasks that cause us to feel fulfilled rather than just entertained are neglected and we can't focus on them as well.</p>
