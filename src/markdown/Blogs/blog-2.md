      <h2>January</h2>
      <p>Finally, in January of 2022, I decided that I would launch a business. Despite the fact that it is a little business, I believe it will be enjoyable, and I had a business idea. I've often wondered how people launch new businesses. I'm prepared for anything could occur in this industry. I'm aware it won't work, but I'll still learn from it. stepping into the corporate world.</p>

      <h2>February</h2>
      <p>I operated my new business for three weeks and felt stupid. I was naive. Creating a product and delivering it to a consumer is a business, but I was mistaken. It is more than that in business. If I were to operate a legitimate business, I would have to provide clients with more than simply a product, but with a product of high quality. That's how I remain ahead of the competition. The end of the new venture.</p>

      <p>In my whole life, Naver wouldn't be as productive. I really like it, from the creation of the fabric to its delivery to the buyer, absolutely loving it. The narrative goes on.</p>

      <h2>September</h2>
      <p>Academic study makes me sick. Covid hits went back to my homeland and finished my undergrad online after only one semester on my campus. What a shame. I never imagined I'd have to finish my undergrad in this way. Life continues.</p>

      <h2>December</h2>
      <p>I moved to a new house. Making plans for a new business. This year, I learnt a lot from the mistakes I made. I meet new individuals and expand my network. I don't regret moving outside of my comfort zone. Making this blog a reminder to my new self that I was dumb and naive, but I can achieve my goals. Next year will be difficult, but I'm determined.</p>
