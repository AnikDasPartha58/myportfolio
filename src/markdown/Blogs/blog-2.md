      <h2>January</h2>
      <p>Finally, in January of 2022, I decided that I would launch a business. Despite the fact that it's a little business, I believe it will be enjoyable. I've often wondered how people launch new businesses. I'm prepared for anything could occur in this industry. I'm aware it won't work, but I'll still learn from it.<span style="color:#222"> Stepping into the corporate world.</span></p>

      <h2>February</h2>
      <p>I operated my new business for three weeks and felt stupid. I was naive. Creating a product and delivering it to a consumer is a business, but I was mistaken. It is more than that in business. If I were to operate a legitimate business, I would have to provide clients with more than simply a product, but with a product of high quality. That's how I remain ahead of the competition.<span style="color:#222"> The end of the new venture.</span></p>

      <h2>June</h2>
      <p>In my whole life, Naver wouldn't be as productive. I really like it, from the creation of the fabric to its delivery to the buyer, absolutely loving it.<span style="color:#222">The narrative goes on.</span></p>

      <h2>July</h2>
      <p>Despite my business, I also make a living through a side hustle. providing a class 3 student with home tutoring. I recognize the 10-year-old myself in this youngster.<span style="color:#222"> I'm disappointed.</span></p>

      <h2>September</h2>
      <p>Academic study makes me sick. Covid hits went back to my homeland and finished my undergrad online after only one semester on my campus. What a shame. I never imagined I'd have to finish my undergrad in this way.<span style="color:#222"> Life continues.</span></p>

      <h2>November</h2>
      <p>I believe that new business tactics are effective. Expanding my brand recognition on the Ruet campus. It's a gamble,<span style="color:#222"> but I like it.</span></p>

      <h2>December</h2>
      <p>I moved to a new house. Making plans for a new business. This year, I learnt a lot from the mistakes I made. I meet new individuals and expand my network. I don't regret moving outside of my comfort zone. Making this blog a reminder to my new self that I was dumb and naive, but I can achieve my goals.<span style="color:#222"> Next year will be difficult, but I'm determined.</span></p>
